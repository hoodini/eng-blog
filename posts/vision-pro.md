# Spatial Computing

I've been living in the Vision Pro for 6 months.

SwiftUI is incredible here. The way you can just add a `.windowStyle(.volumetric)` modifier and suddenly you have a 3D object in your living room is mind-blowing.

I built a simple app to visualize Neural Networks in 3D space. Being able to walk *through* a transformer architecture changed how I understood them.
