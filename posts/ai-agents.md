# The Rise of AI Agents

The landscape of Artificial Intelligence is shifting rapidly. We are moving from the era of "Chatbots" - passive responders - to "Agents" - active doers.

## What defines an Agent?

An agent isn't just an LLM. It's an LLM equipped with:
1. **Tools**: The ability to access the web, run code, or query databases.
2. **Planning**: The capacity to break down complex goals into steps.
3. **Memory**: Remembering past interactions and state.

> "The future of AI is not just about better models, but about better systems that use those models."

## Key Frameworks

We are seeing a explosion of frameworks:
- **LangChain / LangGraph**: The industry standard for orchestration.
- **AutoGPT**: The open source pioneer.
- **Semantic Kernel**: Microsoft's strong contender.

Building agents requires a shift in mindset. You are no longer writing a script; you are defining a probabilistic system's boundaries.
