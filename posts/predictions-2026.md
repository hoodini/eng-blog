# 2026 Predictions

1. **Rust** becomes the default for tooling (already happening).
2. **Wasm** finally unlocks server-side portability.
3. **Frontend** gets simpler as AI handles the glue code.
4. **Backend** gets more complex as we manage vector stores and agent state.

It's a great time to be a builder.
