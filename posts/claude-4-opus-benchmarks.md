# Claude 4 Opus vs GPT-5: Head to Head

The AI coding wars have heated up. With Anthropic's Claude 4 Opus and OpenAI's GPT-5 both claiming developer supremacy, we put them to the test.

## Our Testing Methodology

We evaluated both models across 15 categories:
- Algorithm implementation
- Bug detection and fixing
- Code refactoring
- API design
- System architecture
- Database query optimization

## The Surprising Results

| Task | Claude 4 Opus | GPT-5 |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Complex Algorithms | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Bug Detection | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Code Explanation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| System Design | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## Key Takeaways

**Claude 4 Opus excels at:**
- Long-context understanding (200K tokens)
- Following complex instructions precisely
- Explaining reasoning step-by-step

**GPT-5 shines in:**
- Creative problem solving
