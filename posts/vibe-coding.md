# Vibe Coding

There's a new term floating around Twitter: **Vibe Coding**. It captures the essence of programming with an AI pair programmer like Cursor or Copilot.

## Coding at the Speed of Thought

Traditionally, you had to translate your high-level intent into low-level syntax. You had to worry about semicolons, types, and imports.

With Vibe Coding, you stay at the intent level.
* "Make this component look like Apple News."
* "Refactor this to be more performant."
* "Fix that weird bug with the scrollbar."

## The Risk

The risk, of course, is losing understanding. If you only vibe code, do you truly know how your system works? It's a balance we all must find.
